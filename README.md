# bash-scripts

This repository is a collection of Bash scripts that I've developed and utilized throughout my career and mainly for personal Homelab automation. The scripts vary from simple system administration tasks and file manipulation to more complex automation workflows for server management, data backups, and other recurring activities. 

The goal is to keep them organized, documented, and readily accessible for anyone that maybe wants to make use of it and extend it with new improvements.
